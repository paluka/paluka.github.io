                <p class="researchParagraph center" style="float: none;">We performed a perception study to examine the human's ability to perceive relative depth of stereoscopically and monoscopically rendered two-dimensional shapes. Participants were required to estimate the relative distance ratios of shapes with respect to a reference object.

                    To display stereoscopic 3D content, a TFT-LCD monitor, model ZM-M240W, by Zalman Tech. Co., Ltd. was used. It is a passive stereoscopic 3D LCD monitor requiring polarized 3D glasses. The screen resolution was set to 1920x1080. Questions were displayed on a second monitor, and could be answered by using a mouse. 
                   </p>
                <p class="researchParagraph center" style="float:none;">
                   To avoid accidental motion parallax, blurring effects, as well as fluctuations in perceived depths, each participant was required to place their head on a chin rest. While seated, the distance from each participant's forehead was made to be exactly 1 metre away from the base of the 3D monitor.</p>

                        Our hypotheses:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stereoscopic viewing condition would improve relative depth perception compared to the monoscopic viewing condition</li>
                            <li>Estimating relative depth distances would have an accuracy of fifty percent or less in both viewing conditions</li>
                            <li>Shape type would not affect relative depth estimation accuracy</li>
                            <li>Confidence levels would be higher for the stereoscopic viewing condition</li>
